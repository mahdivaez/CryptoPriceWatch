CryptoPriceWatch is a dynamic web application built using React, CSS, HTML, and JavaScript. It serves as a comprehensive cryptocurrency price tracker, allowing users to search and view the latest prices, 24-hour changes, and daily changes for various cryptocurrencies. This project showcases my skills in working with APIs, front-end development, and integrating data from external sources. Through this project, I aim to enhance my knowledge of web development technologies and gain hands-on experience in building responsive and interactive user interfaces. Join me on this learning journey as we explore the exciting world of cryptocurrencies and real-time data visualization.
